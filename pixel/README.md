What is Pixels? Pixels was Python Discord event where you draw on canvas a pixel at the time. You can see their github here: https://github.com/python-discord/pixels

What does that have to do with this rest of this repo? Absolutely nothing. I was working on this project when this event happened and Pixel editing code landed here. So if you are wondering in here and confused, back out slowly.
